        <p>As a dedicated .NET Full Stack Developer, I specialize in building robust, scalable, and high-performance web applications using the Microsoft technology stack. I have hands-on experience in developing backend services with ASP.NET Core and C#, along with dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as Angular or React. My skill set includes working with SQL Server, RESTful APIs, Entity Framework, and integrating third-party services to create efficient end-to-end solutions. With a strong understanding of software development life cycles, version control (Git), and agile methodologies, I strive to deliver clean, maintainable code that aligns with business goals and enhances user experience</p>
