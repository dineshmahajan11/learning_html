        <h1>A hotel is an establishment that provides lodging, meals, and other services for travelers and tourists. Hotels vary widely in size, quality, and amenitiesâ€”from budget accommodations to luxury resorts. Most hotels offer basic features such as furnished rooms, private bathrooms, room service, Wi-Fi, and housekeeping. Higher-end hotels may include additional facilities like swimming pools, fitness centers, business lounges, conference rooms, and in-house restaurants. Guests typically check in at the reception desk, and booking can be done in advance online or on arrival. Hotels play a key role in the hospitality industry, catering to both leisure and business travelers with a focus on comfort, convenience, and customer service.</h1>
